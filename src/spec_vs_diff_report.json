  "summary": "Diff focuses on frontend runtime error normalization and UI surfacing of technical details (stack/raw error, request/canister/method) via AsyncState and a StartupErrorBoundary. There is no evidence of changes to build/deploy tooling or of a new build/deploy attempt with captured deployment logs, so REQ-15’s deploy-success and deploy-log capture aspects are not implemented in the shown diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Retry the application build and deployment, capture the full deployment error output, and fix the underlying issue so the canisters and frontend deploy successfully on the Internet Computer.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only frontend TypeScript/React changes for runtime error handling and UI display. There are no changes to deployment configuration/scripts, no backend/canister build adjustments, and no evidence of capturing and surfacing full *deployment* command output/stack traces for diagnosis, nor evidence that `dfx deploy` now succeeds.",

      "reason": "REQ-15 is about build/deploy failure resolution and capturing *deployment* error output; these runtime UX/error-normalization enhancements are not explicitly requested and may be considered new functionality beyond deploy stability work.",

    {
      "description": "UI for displaying and copying technical error details in AsyncState error cards (collapsible ‘Technical details’, copy-to-clipboard).",
